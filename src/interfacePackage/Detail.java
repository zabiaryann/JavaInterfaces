	/*In Java, an interface is a reference type that is similar to a class. 
	 *It is a collection of abstract methods (methods without a body) that
	 *any class implementing the interface must provide concrete implementations
	 *for. In essence, an interface defines a contract that classes must adhere to,
	 *specifying what methods they must implement without dictating how they should
	 *be implemented. This enables multiple classes to share a common set of methods 
	 *without the need for a shared base class.*/
